Virtual Hardware

68000

Memory
------
RAM at 0 for 512K

Quite how the boot code magically teleports from ROM into RAM is not
emulated, as it doesn't matter.

IDE
---
A "classic" 16bit IDE controller at 00F01000, with registers at 2 byte
intervals to allow for a 16bit data register

No interrupt


"simple" MMU
------------
$00F02000 sets the mask bits of the MMU
$00F02010 sets the root (xor) bits of the MMU
$00F02020 is a fault flag which is set when the MMU faults, and
	  cleared by reading it or acking the interrupt

The faulting address is not captured as it's meant to be a simple MMU.

The addressing rules are

Supervisor:	always linear
User:		physical = (virtual & mask) ^ root

and a fault is raised if the unmasked bits are not all 0 or 1.

IRQ 7	(may change to NMI or bus error when experimenting more, but it's
	 interesting as an IRQ because that is generic to all CPUs)

Serial Port
-----------
$00F03000 read/write byte writes or fetches data
$00F03010 read - bit 0 indicates character for reading, bit 1 write space

(Need to add a couple of extra ports via pty or similar)

Currently no interrupt, need to add


** To implement**

RTC/Timer
---------
$00F04000 set the timer rate or disable if 0
$00F04010 read the current unsigned unix time
$00F04020 read the current deciseconds value 0-9

IRQ 6, cleared by acking

Framebuffer

Proper CPU clock locking



Virtual Software

Boot loads block 0 from IDE device 0 to 0x1000 and if 0x1000 contains the
magic number 15C0DE68 then it jumps to 0x1004 with A6 holding the pointer to
the service jump table and D0 holding the number of the boot disk. IRQs are off
and supervisor mode is in force.

The provided services are a jump table off a6

Halt		0

Returns to the boot prompt assuming you didn't trash the low memory

Chrout		1

Output the character in D0

Strout		2

Output the string in A3 (may change to A2 shortly)

Chrin		3

Read the next character into D0, wait if needed

Chrpoll		4

Return D0 bit 0 true for read ready D0 bit 1 true for write ready

Strin		5

Call with A2 as a buffer pointer and D2 as the buffer length including the
\0 and the routine will do line input handling

DiskRead	6

Read disk block D1 from device D0 into memory at address A0


All service routines may trash A0/D0/A1/D1 and the passed arguments. All
service routines are likely to change! All are intended to be used from
supervisor mode only
